### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Predictions

#### Sentiment Analysis
We trained a sentiment analysis model using the transformers package and the DistilBERT pretrained model for transfer learning. We chose to make this a regression model instead of a classification model, hoping that this would allow more of the subtleties of sentiment to show in our predictions.
