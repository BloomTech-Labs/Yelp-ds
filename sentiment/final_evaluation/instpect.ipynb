      "SCRUBTASTIC came to Sunrise Hospital (Las Vegas) for Nurses Week selling scrubs. No RETURN/EXCHANGE POLICY posted on-site or even on the e-mail receipt (there is no paper receipt btw!). Few days later I found out their scrubs are overly priced (like $13-$15 over) than online sellers. I purchased 6 pairs of scrubs. So I went to the store to return my purchase and they told me that the policy (which is clearly posted by the cashier at the actual store) is NO RETURN/REFUND and only EXCHANGES could be made. The \"owner\" FRANK K. came over to me as I was talking it out with his employees and said I was being \"argumentative\" and that I have to get out of the store. He then abruptly took my purchases and walked me out of the store saying he cannot help me resolve this issue and that I have to get out. There were customers around and truth is he doesn't want these customers to hear how overly priced their products are. Also, nevermind how overly priced their products are but how he mistreated his customer who came to talk to solve issues with his store and its products. Lesson learned, never buy from an unknown retailer. It's my first time buying from them and never will I ever do another purchase. www.uniformadvantage.com is way better and way cheaper, shipping for purchase more than $99.00 is free. Even tax free! And more items to choose from. Think twice before going to this place, don't let them take your $$$. Also I will make sure this goes out to all my coworkers at Sunrise Hospital and the administration, and friends from other hospitals around the valley too. We from the healthcare team don't need this kind of retailer!\n",

      "I guess a part of making a nightclub popular is to be an a$$hole. For this they deserve 6 stars. The place was pretty meh, though admittedly I am not a club going person anymore, there was once a time that I was and I would not have been impressed then either. As expected, the drinks were overpriced, the entry was annoying, and the wait to go inside was too long. But I guess that's part of the \"charm.\" What probably annoyed me the most was that we were in the balcony section and they closed it down, most likely because Cash Cash (the name of the DJ's on that night) sucks and they couldn't get enough people in this craphole to keep the balcony open. The house DJ mixed some good jams and I was sad to have them leave and be exposed to Cash Cash. EDM is not my jam but crappy music is crappy music. And as mentioned previously, shout out to the a$$hole security at this place, you da real POS. Also, I am always surprised to see how much people are willing to pay for bottle service.
