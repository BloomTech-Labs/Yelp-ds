      "All of the products are good, I love the truffle goat cheese. However some of the staff are just rude. I went there for lunch to get a sandwich, meanwhile two other people came in and ordered as well, the guy behind the counter rolled his eyes and huffed: \"of course your here for lunch, we are surrounded by sandwich shops you have just HAVE to come here\"  I thought that was odd and chimed in, \"this place must be the best\" he just seemed annoyed and said: \"it's really not, but I guess you can do whatever\" I found that so off putting, it was the first time I decided to have a deli sandwich for lunch and although good, it's considerably more expensive than the other options as Panera, JJ, and subway are walking distance. I don't understand why he was so annoyed doing his job and why he would encourage customers to go elsewhere.. UPDATE: after the owner resolved the issue I believe my initial review may be too harsh and don't want it to be a deterrent for others trying this place. I do think the products are exceptional and I should speak more to that. The sandwiches are unique and worth trying.\n",
