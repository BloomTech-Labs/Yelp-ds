I called at 8:30am and they got us in at 9:30am. My husband went in and paid and signed the form and came out to get me and my cat. My husband said it was so nice inside and didn't feel like a vets office at all.  We went into a side room away from the lobby. What I noticed most was that my cat wasn't laying on a cold metal table.  Instead there was a nice soft blanket waiting for him. They took him and did a paw print and got the catheter started.  We were given as much time as needed.  Dr. Bestic was wonderful.  I've euthanized pets in the past but this was the absolute best experience.  He went so quickly and peacefully. They gave us as much time as we needed afterwards.  I chose to have him privately cremated with Paws Awhile which they take care of for me.  He will be returned to me in about a week in a nice wood box with his name engraved on it.  I couldn't be happier and I'm certain that Dr. Bestic will become the veterinarian for our dog and other cats.\n",
