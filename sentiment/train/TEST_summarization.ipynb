      "(1/4) Unfortunately, no-star reviews cannot be issued. I felt it was paramount that I inform potential customers of Absolute Dental about their shady business practices. Please take my unfortunate experience as a lesson and a warning for you to go ELSEWHERE. I should have. It is not that much more expensive to go to a private practice. For those of you Spanish speakers, there is always at least one person that speaks Spanish in a dental office. Please do not go to Absolute Dental like I did because you're too intimidated to go somewhere that looks expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had traditional, porcelain-bracket braces put on back in May. From the get-go, I had technicians that would drop tools and implements and pick them up from the ground to reuse them. However, not all were unprofessional. Every single time I came in for a 4-week visit to adjust my braces, I would wait 30 minutes to an hour with no explanation. Throughout my 8-Month Treatment, this location changed managers, technicians, and doctors without any notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearing the end of my Treatment, I was asked whether I wanted a traditional metal retainer or an Invisalign Retainer. I opted for the Invisalign option (per the doctor's suggestion) and was given an appointment to remove the braces and have a Retainer made. I was promised the Retainer could be made in-house and immediately given to me - all one 3-4 hour appointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came in 4 weeks later for the removal appointment and was told the machine was not yet in the office. No one thought it was necessary to give me a call and let me know so I didn't waste my time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came in 2 weeks from then as directed and upon arrival, was looked at in confusion as to why I was there. I was told I was never even on the schedule and I was not due for another two weeks. I remember having sat down with the new manager to schedule who guaranteed she would give me a call and let me know their extra special \"Essex Retainer\" machine was ready for me. Obviously, I never received a call then either so I should have known something would go wrong. I was told to come in another two weeks later \"for real this time.\" They scheduled me and DID NOT replace any of the wiring or rubber bands in my mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another two weeks later, third attempt - I'm told at my appointment that their machine is not working and they haven't tested it out yet and they they needed to because they wanted to make sure it could create a retainer effectively. Interestingly enough, any time I tried calling their office, I would reach their corporate call center (that has terrible customer service skills) and would be disconnected, transferred without notice, or told I'd be called back. Why was I not called to be told this? Is my time not valuable or important like everyone else's? I leave in complete dismay and frustration because yet again, nothing in my mouth was replaced and was told to come back on January 20th with a \"guarantee\" that everything would be good to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I finally called corporate AGAIN and told them that this was unacceptable and I was willing to go to any office to have these braces removed and I was open to having a metal retainer if an Invisalign one was impossible to make. I was told I'd be called back. Never was. I call back the next day and I'm told that Vicki, the manager of the 4035 S Durango Dr location approved to get me in the following Saturday to have the braces removed with an Invisalign retainer free of charge, and if I went to another location I'd be charged $600 for a retainer. I was given Vicki's phone number. I called, she answered and told me that I had an appointment for Saturday, January 6th at 8:00am to have my braces removed and a retainer made all in one day. She gave me a \"guarantee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One week passes, I come in two days ago and I'm told that their retainer machine's product was \"too soft\" and \"unusable\". The doctor also told me I was not supposed to come in until the 20th, even though I was told by the manager and corporate to come in on this day. I asked to speak to Vicki, the manager. She came across extremely unprofessional, unhelpful, and not compassionate of the situation at all. With crossed arms, she told me that when I called her she was \"not even in the office and she was on her day off and driving in the car\" and how she \"never would have answered for anyone else\", pretty much suggesting that I was a fool for believing that I could be treated on this day. Maybe that's how she speaks to every customer there?\n",
      "\n",
      "Completely fed up and done, I told Dr. Najeeb and Vicki that I wanted my braces OFF and I would have a retainer made elsewhere. They tried to talk me out of it, I was not hearing it and insisted on having them removed. They had me sign some ridiculous yellow piece of paper that said I was choosing to have my braces removed against their advice and how I was not fully completing my treatment (even though I was supposed to have my braces removed at the end of November).
